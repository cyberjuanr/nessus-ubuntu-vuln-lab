# 🔒 Ubuntu Vulnerability Scanning Lab (Nessus Essentials)

Hands-on Linux vulnerability scanning, CVSS analysis, remediation, and validation using Nessus Essentials on an Ubuntu VM running in Parallels Desktop.

---

## 🔎 Vulnerability Management Lab Overview
Performed a full vulnerability scanning and remediation workflow on an Ubuntu Linux virtual machine.  
Identified security weaknesses using Nessus Essentials, prioritized risks using CVSS scores, applied Linux-based patching and system hardening, and validated risk reduction through a post-remediation scan.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Vulnerability Scanning (Host-Based)  
- CVSS Score Interpretation  
- Linux System Hardening  
- Patch & Update Management (APT)  
- Firewall Configuration (UFW)  
- Service and Package Remediation  
- Post-Remediation Validation  
- Security Documentation & Reporting  
- Virtualization (Parallels Desktop on macOS)

## 🎯 Lab Objectives
1. Launch Parallels Desktop & prepare Ubuntu environment  
2. Install and configure Nessus Essentials  
3. Run initial vulnerability scan against Ubuntu VM  
4. Analyze results and prioritize findings (Critical → Low)  
5. Apply Linux remediation steps  
   - Patch management with `apt`  
   - Package updates/removal  
   - Firewall hardening with UFW  
6. Re-scan the VM to validate fixes  
7. Compare before/after results  
8. Document commands, findings, and screenshots  
9. Publish full lab to GitHub
